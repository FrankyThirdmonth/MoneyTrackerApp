# MoneyTracker

My first project on GitHub! 
It consist to have a digital wallet to write down all charges or entries, in order to track them whenever you want.

I'm new to Android Development, less than 8 months ago I've learnt for the first time how to print "Hello world" in Java. So the code is surely not the best it can be, and probably full of bugs.

But I enjoyed so much to put in practice all the theory seen in those month! I appreciate if anyone with more experience then me could give me feedbacks about what is not good in this code.

# Disclaimers

* I've tried to put everything I learnt in one project, such as Dependency Injection, Navigation Components, Room DB, LiveData in a MMVM architecture. Each of the points above are surely not implemented in the best way.
* Building UI is one of the things I didn't spent time to learn in these 8 months. To build graph I used MPAndroidChart library     in the basics functionality. 
* This project runs on API 24+ devices.

# Features
